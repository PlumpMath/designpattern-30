<note>
<intent>
<para>Intent Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.</para>
</intent>
<motivation>
<para>Sometimes a toolkit or class library cannot be used because its interface is 
incompatible with the interface required by an application 
</para>
<para>We cannot change the library interface</para>
<para>Even if we did have the source code, we should not change the library</para>
</motivation>
<applicability>
<para>Use the Adapter pattern when: You want to use an existing class that performs similar functions but with a different interface. </para>
</applicability>
