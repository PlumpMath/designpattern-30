		<para>Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a
			subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the
			subsystem easier to use.
		</para>
	</intent>
	<motivation>
		<para> a. Structuring a system into subsystems helps reduce
			complexity.
			b. Subsystems are groups of classes, and/or other
			subsystems.
			c. The interface exposed by the classes in a subsystem or
			set of
			subsystems
			can become quite complex.
			d. One way to reduce this complexity is to
			introduce a facade object
			that provides a single,
			simplified
			interface to the more general
			facilities of a subsystem.
