		<para>
			e. Your application deals with a potentially large number of
			objects of the same type, which may take a huge amount of memory
			space.
			f. For these objects, their states can be easily externalized.
			g. For each type of objects, you can choose to process them one by
			one, not all at once.
			h. Performance of the application is not
			critical sometimes.

		<para>The Flyweight pattern's effectiveness depends heavily on how and
			where it's used. Apply the Flyweight pattern when all of the
			following are true: 
			a. An application uses a large number of objects.
			b. Storage costs are high because of the sheer quantity of objects.
			c. Most object state can be made extrinsic. 
			d. Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once extrinsic state	is removed. 
			e. Creating a new object has to be much more expensive than object retrieval from the factory 
			(getting a shared copy from the factory involves expensive operations from a Hash Map too).
