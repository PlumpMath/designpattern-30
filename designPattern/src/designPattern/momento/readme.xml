		<para>Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an
			object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this
			state later.
		</para>
	</intent>
	<motivation>
		<para>a. Sometimes it's necessary to record the internal state of an
			object. This is required when implementing checkpoints and undo
			mechanisms that let users back out of tentative operations or recover
			from errors. b. You must save state information somewhere so that you
			can restore objects to their previous states
		</para>
	</motivation>
	<applicability>
		<para>Use the Memento pattern when a. A snapshot of (some portion of)
			an object's state must be saved so that it can be restored to that
			state later, and b. A direct interface to obtaining the state would
			expose implementation details and break the object's encapsulation.
