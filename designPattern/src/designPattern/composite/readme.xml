	<intent>
		<para>Compose objects into tree structures to represent partwhole or
			parent-child hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual
			objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
	</intent>
	<motivation>
		<para>Many times you need to model a system that deals with
			relationships between objects that are of the same type but on
			different levels (for example in whole-part, parent-child, or
			supervisor-employee, relationships.) and in your system the number of
			levels is unknown until runtime.
		</para>
	</motivation>
	<applicability>
		<para>Use the Composite pattern when a. You want to represent
			part-whole or parent-child hierarchies of objects b. You want clients
			to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects
			and individual objects. Clients will treat all objects in the
			composite structure uniformly.
