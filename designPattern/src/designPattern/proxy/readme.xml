		<para>Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
			access to it
		</para>
	</intent>
	<motivation>
		<para> To defer the full cost of its creation and initialization until
			we actually need to use it.
		</para>
		<para> There are situations in which a client does not or cannot
			reference an object directly,
			but wants to still interact with the object
		</para>
		<para>A proxy object can act as the intermediary between the client
			and the target object
		</para>
	</motivation>
	<applicability>
		<para>Remote Proxy - Provides a reference to an object located in a
			different address space on the same or different machine
		</para>
		<para>Protection (Access) Proxy - Provides different clients with
			different levels of access to a target object
		</para>
		<para> Cache Proxy - Provides temporary storage of the results of
			expensive target operations so that multiple clients can share the
			results
		</para>
